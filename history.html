      <h2>153 Miles of History</h2>
      <p class="historyp">
        The Buffalo National River, a 153-mile-long river in the Ozark Plateau,
        became the first national river in the United States on March 1, 1972.
        It flows freely for 135 miles and is one of the last undammed rivers in
        the lower 48 states. It was established by President Nixon and placed
        under the protection of the National Park Service 100 years after
        Yellowstone National Park's establishment. The river has been an
        attraction for its inhabitants since prehistoric times and has two state
        parks along its course.
      </p>

      <p class="historyp">
        The Buffalo River was not officially documented until the early nineteenth century, with no known sites. 
        The Osage, Cherokee, and Shawnee tribes had significant influence on the area before Anglo settlement. 
        Settlers began settling in the late 1820s, with land ownership becoming possible in 1845. 
        Federal surveys provide information on vegetation, natural features, settler names, roads, and structures. 
        Public land books mostly date back to 1880-1915, with descendants of older settlers using log structures and new road systems. 
        Entries continued until 1956.
      </p>

      <p class="historyp">
        In the 1960s, opposing organizations formed to oppose a dam on the
        Buffalo River. Governor Orval Faubus withdrew his support in 1965,
        leading to the introduction of the first Buffalo National River Park
        legislation in 1967. The park, which covers 94,293 acres, allows hunting
        and fishing as traditional uses and offers permanent residents the
        option of use and occupancy for up to 25 years.
      </p>

      <p class="historyp">
        The Buffalo River has experienced several algal blooms since
        establishing a C&H/Cargill hog farm in 2013, but in 2018, the Arkansas
        Department of Environmental Quality denied C&H's permit to operate the
        farm, making it one of America's Most Endangered Rivers. The park is a
        popular tourist destination in Arkansas, with over 800,000 visitors
        annually. It includes 135 miles of river, 100 miles of hiking trails,
        and three congressionally designated wilderness areas. 
        On April 8th, 2024, tourists in the Buffalo National River 
        witnessed the rare totality of the Solar Eclipse that passed through
        the State of Arkansas and across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
      </p>

      <p class="historyp">
        The park also features four historic districts on the National Register
        and individual sites depicting the cultural history of the river's
        peoples. The Arkansas Farm Bureau officially adopted a policy opposing
        any potential redesignation.

        <h2>Unique Fun Facts:</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <ul>
            <li>The Buffalo National River is home to a fossil record that spans over 180 million years, including those of crinoids, ancient sea creatures related to starfish and sea urchins, and bears, peccaries, giant armadillos, and hundreds of pounds of additional bone material.</li>
            <li>The Buffalo River is home to 200 species of birds and 55 species of mammals, including the Bald Eagle, Northern Bobwhite, Cerulean Warbler, Swainson's Warbler, and Louisiana Waterthrush.</li>
            <li>The Buffalo National River got its name from the common occurrence of the American bison in the vicinity of the Buffalo. The word buffalo is derived from the French "buf," a name given to bison when French fur trappers working in the US in the early 1600s saw the animals.</li>
            <li>The Buffalo National River in Northwest Arkansas is the first in Arkansas, the 26th National Park Service site, and the 71st in the world to receive the designation of an International Dark Sky Park.</li>
